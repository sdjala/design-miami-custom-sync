Returning to a creative place of child-like wonder and curiosity, Toogood enlisted rudimentary, readily-accessible materials – paper and tape, canvas and foam, to craft unforced and uncontrived, small-scale maquettes of objects with functional potentialities. Transposed to full-scale proportions, every detail of her Canvas and Foam Sofa miniature, down to the minutiae, has been carefully considered and masterfully recreated. Primed.",

Finding the surreal in the quotidian, his playful, off-the-wall objects offer a nuanced commentary on the universal language of consumerism. Exemplary of Trayte’s tongue-in-cheek sensibility, Boobie (2021), a 2.3-meter stack of powder pink aluminum orbs, is axiomatic of Trayte’s embrace of contradictions between the organic and the artificial. Rendered from naïve forms with a pastel palette and child-like title, Boobie points to the link between the media and the sexualization of form and color. Trayte himself says, “Color is so important as a means of persuasion, persuading people to consume in particular kinds of ways, or in appealing to specific social groups. I create synthetic painted veneers and compositions of materials that either reflect or distort this language; they're like skins of paint or textures that create a kind of chameleon appearance…”.

            "description": "Leif Stangebye-Nielsen is a metal artist with a main emphasis on silver corpus. He is particularly concerned with the concept of form where the totality of figuration, material, space and tactility portrays the ideas. The metals’ ability to forge will witness in the works the heavy, physical process it has undergone. A dialogue between the artist and the material over time. The love of the materials, techniques and tools is used to communicate, create situations and experiences for viewers. It is not about entertaining or writing in capital letters, but about touching the individual and cultivating the human right to find peace and experience close sensual values in a hurried and chaotic society. Leif Stangebye-Nielsen has had several solo exhibitions and participated in a number of group exhibitions in Norway and internationally. He received the craft prize in 1988 and is represented in all the larger collections of handicrafts in Norway and the Victoria & Albert museum in London.",
            "descriptionHtml": "<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<p>Leif Stangebye-Nielsen is a metal artist with a main emphasis on silver corpus. He is particularly concerned with the concept of form where the totality of figuration, material, space and tactility portrays the ideas. The metals’ ability to forge will witness in the works the heavy, physical process it has undergone. A dialogue between the artist and the material over time. The love of the materials, techniques and tools is used to communicate, create situations and experiences for viewers. It is not about entertaining or writing in capital letters, but about touching the individual and cultivating the human right to find peace and experience close sensual values in a hurried and chaotic society.</p>\n<p>Leif Stangebye-Nielsen has had several solo exhibitions and participated in a number of group exhibitions in Norway and internationally.

            "description": "Christina Peel’s work is a quest into the geometric forms, volume and structure of the material she is working with – into their interplay and relationships. She works with clay, and creates complex wall pieces which relate either to a specific framed size or to a site-specific project. “Plane #2” and “Plane #3” were featured in Peel’s recent exhibition at Format. The exhibition, titled Transitions, featured a new series of three-dimensional wall pieces in porcelain. These works are experienced as rhythmic abstract compositions where the details, being variations on a common element, make up a whole. Here the interplay between form and color can be experienced as something constant or in a state of flux, and very small movements by the viewer can modify the perception of the work.",
